In planning the next stage of my cabinet build, I began crunching numbers to develop a cutlist for the cabinet doors. I've grown tired of all of the mental math and silly sketches that have been necessary in many of this project's stages, so I built a simple calculator to automate at least _some_ of the more tedious calculating needed to build shaker style cabinet doors.

What's published at the time of this post is very much "Version 1", but I expect to make small tweaks in the future. The general styling of the page leaves much to be desired, so I'll probably start there.
